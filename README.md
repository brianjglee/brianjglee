## Projects
### Predicting Home Value with a Random Forest Regressor
[Project Link](https://github.com/brianjglee/zillow-time-series-rfr)

Scraped housing data from the Zillow website using **python**, imported into pandas DataFrame, cleaned, performed exploratory analysis, and created a machine learning model using random forest regressor to predict the home value of current listings.

### Personal Finance Dashboard using PowerBI

Extracted transactions from bank statement pdfs using **python**, imported into a csv file, cleaned the data in **PowerBI**, and created a personal finance dashboard that displays overall or monthly overview of spending and earnings. 

### Uber Supply and Demand Data Analysis
[Project Link](https://github.com/brianjglee/uber-supply-demand)

Using a provided dataset, we import the csv file into a **pandas** dataframe, clean the data, use **pandasql** for **SQL** style queries, and pandas **to_datetime**, **merge**, **plot**, and **groupby** functions to gather insights for the business. 

### Cocktail Recommendations using Natural Language Processing and 
[Project Link](https://github.com/brianjglee/cocktail-recommendations)
What cocktails do you like? How do you know what to order at a bar? Cocktails are overwhelming. The goal of this project was to use natural language processing to recommend cocktails. Using **spaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, we created a model to extract the names of cocktails that redditors enjoyed. With the help of **PRAW**, Reddit's webscraping API, we compiled a list of text from multiple reddit comments. Then, using the NER model, we extracted cocktail names from these posts. After creating a spell checker function, using the distance between two strings, we create a dictionary of cocktail names to correct the spelling mistakes in these posts. Finally, we explore the data using association rules. In particular, **mlxtend's frequent pattern growth algorithm** shows us commonly grouped cocktails in each post. We also created an **item item collaborative filtering** to recommend a cocktail using a correlation matrix.
